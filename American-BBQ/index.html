      <p class="paragraph-reviews">I enjoyed my experience at American BBQ. The service and food were fantastic and not one order was wrong which is a relif for everyone as some of my kids and wife are gluten free which makes it hard to go out to eat.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-reviews">I love this resturant so much. Everyone is so nice and polite and the waiters all make jokes to keep you occupied while you are waiting. I love the flavors and the prices fit my families budget so we eat here any time we can.</p>
